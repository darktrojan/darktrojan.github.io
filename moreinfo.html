<h1>Network issues on registrationform.co.nz</h1>

<p><i>Update: everything seems to be working okay now. I can't rule out further problems though.</i></p>

<p>Some users have reported network issues, and I think I have partially tracked down the problem. If the behaviour I have noticed is consistent, you should be able to use the website by <b>not using Google Chrome</b> (possibly also Safari and related programs such as the iPhone browser), and by <b>waiting 5-10 minutes since you last tried to access the site.</b></p>

<p>Sorry for the inconvenience. I am trying to get to the root of the issue, and of course, this would happen in my busiest week of the year!</p>
